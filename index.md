# G
Short answer: yes — $\varepsilon_t$ is exactly the right place to model a manager’s *added value* (mentorship, decision filtering, unsticking blockers, calibration) — but you need measurable signals and an experimental/analytical approach to separate real value from paperwork (approvals-without-reading) and survivor bias.

Below I give a compact playbook you can use immediately:

1. observable signals to track (quick checklist),
2. lightweight experiments you can run to measure causal effect, and
3. a simple statistical model + runnable Python snippet to *estimate* a manager’s (\varepsilon) (difference vs expectation / controls).

---

## 1) Signals that indicate a manager is *actually* adding value

Measure several of these (no single metric rules):

Operational / output signals

* **Quality delta**: change in quality score of deliverables after manager review (QA score, peer score, bug count).
* **Rework rate**: fraction of tasks sent back for rework after approval (lower = better).
* **Approval comments density**: number & substance of comments per approval (short “LGTM” vs substantive suggestions).
* **Time-to-decision**: how fast the manager unblocks vs industry/team baseline.
* **Escalation quality**: when manager escalates, does the upstream decision change in a way that improves outcomes?

Growth & people signals

* **Skill gain**: measurable improvement in subordinate skills (code quality metrics, assessments, test scores).
* **Promotion / retention**: promotions, voluntary attrition, internal mobility.
* **1:1 usefulness**: employee-rated helpfulness of manager in surveys (NPS-style).
* **Mentorship index**: number of career/learning actions suggested & completed.

Systemic signals

* **Outcome alignment**: % of team outputs mapped to OKRs / revenue / customer value.
* **Cross-team friction**: interactions required to get things done (fewer unforced dependencies = manager smoothing).
* **Calibrated decisions**: manager’s approvals correlate with downstream positive outcomes (conversion, uptime, acceptance).

Practical note: collect both objective metrics (bugs, time, rework) and subjective assessments (peer review, 1:1 survey).

---

## 2) Experiments & operational checks (how to test causality)

You want to separate (A) managers who simply rubber-stamp vs (B) managers who change outcomes.

Low-friction experiments:

* **Before/After with holdout**: randomly hold a small set of approvals for blind re-review (by another competent reviewer) and compare downstream outcomes.
* **Rotation**: rotate managers across similar teams for short windows — does subordinate performance follow manager or team context?
* **Blind re-evaluation**: take a random sample of approved deliverables, anonymize manager identity, and have independent reviewers score outcomes.
* **Manager annotations**: require a one-line justification for each approval; correlate justification richness with later quality.
* **A/B manager policy**: one cohort uses manager signoff + coaching; another uses peer review only. Compare metrics (use ethical care).

These experiments give causal leverage; they let you estimate a manager’s (\varepsilon) rather than infer it from correlations.

---

## 3) Simple formal model (how $\varepsilon_t$ fits)

Let subordinate output at time $t$ be $Y_{it}$. Decompose:

$$
Y_{it} = f_i(X_{it}) + \varepsilon_{M(i),t} + u_{it}
$$

Where:

* $f_i(X_{it})$ = expected output given person-level predictors (X) (experience, task difficulty, prior trend).
* $\varepsilon_{M(i),t}$ = manager (M)’s time-dependent added value (what you want).
* $u_{it}$ = idiosyncratic noise.

Estimate $\varepsilon$ by:

* building a prediction $\hat f_i(X_{it})$ (trend model), then
* $\widehat{\varepsilon}*{M,t}$ = average residual for employees under manager (M): residual = $Y*{it} - \hat f_i(X_{it})$.
* Use mixed-effects / hierarchical regression to estimate manager random effects controlling for fixed effects (task difficulty, employee fixed effect).

A simple Difference-in-Differences (DiD) is useful if manager changes at time (T): compare performance before/after vs a control group.

---

## 4) Lightweight Python proof-of-concept

The snippet below shows a simple residual approach (pandas + statsmodels). It assumes you have a table `df` with columns: `employee`, `manager`, `time`, `outcome` (numeric quality), and predictors `difficulty`, `experience`.

```python
# pip install pandas statsmodels
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# df: employee, manager, time, outcome, difficulty, experience
# Example: build a baseline expected model (employee-level and task predictors)
# Fit a regression with employee fixed effects and task predictors
model = smf.ols("outcome ~ C(employee) + difficulty + experience", data=df).fit()
df['pred'] = model.predict(df)
df['resid'] = df['outcome'] - df['pred']

# Aggregated residual by manager/time -> estimate epsilon
eps_by_manager = df.groupby(['manager']).resid.mean().reset_index().rename(columns={'resid':'eps_hat'})
print(eps_by_manager.sort_values('eps_hat', ascending=False).head(10))

# If you have manager changes over time, run a mixed-effect model:
import statsmodels.api as sm
md = sm.MixedLM.from_formula("outcome ~ difficulty + experience", groups="manager", re_formula="1", data=df)
mdf = md.fit()
print(mdf.summary())
# Manager random effect = estimated epsilon_i for each manager
mgr_effects = mdf.random_effects
```

Interpretation:

* Positive manager random effect = manager’s team performs *better* than expected given predictors.
* Use bootstrap or cluster-robust SEs to check statistical significance.

---

## 5) Practical checklist to deploy right now

1. **Instrument**: start capturing outcome, difficulty, reviewer identity, review comments, time-to-approval, rework flag.
2. **Baseline model**: build `f(X)` using past data (employee fixed effect helps).
3. **Compute residuals** per employee-review and aggregate by manager to get $\widehat{\varepsilon}$.
4. **Run experiments**: rotation or blind re-review on small samples to test causal claims.
5. **Combine quantitative + qualitative**: pair the stats with employee survey items: “How helpful was manager X in removing blockers?” (1–5).
6. **Calibrate**: update thresholds — e.g. manager epsilon > 0.05 (5% better than expected) is “adding measurable value”; < 0 or high variance → investigate.

---

## 6) Red flags (when manager is likely *not* adding value)

* Many approvals but **no comments** and high downstream rework.
* Fast approvals but downstream negative outcomes (bugs, complaints, client rejections).
* Team churn or stagnation in skills despite high throughput.
* Lack of 1:1 coaching notes / no career advancement actions.

## 7) Good qualitative signs to pair with the numbers

* Manager surfaces root causes and removes blockers (not just reassigns blame).
* Manager champions team work upward — gets resources, protects team from noise.
* Manager provides specificity in feedback (not “fix this” but “rewrite section X to Y; here’s why”).
* Manager creates patterns of learning (postmortems, blameless crosstalk, playbooks).

---

### Quick example interpretation

* If `eps_hat` for Manager A = +0.12 (12% better residual) and Manager B = -0.05, then A is likely adding measurable value.
* If `eps_hat` is positive but employee surveys say “manager doesn’t help me learn,” dig deeper: maybe manager protects team but doesn’t grow them (still valuable but different).

---

If you want, I can:

* give you a small **pandas notebook** that loads a CSV and runs the exact analysis above and outputs a one-page manager scorecard, or
* draft the **short experiment protocol** (rotation / blind re-review) you can run in 2–4 weeks to produce causal evidence.

Which do you prefer?

Let’s tailor this to your **UN Accounting** context — bureaucratic layers, audit pressures, and moral hazard from “pleasing upward” behavior.

You’re describing a classic **management thermodynamic asymmetry**:
the *upper gradient* (boss-pleasing) pulls energy upward, while the *lower gradient* (reviewing staff output) decays.
In canon terms, the (\varepsilon_t) that *should* be dissipated into subordinate learning gets hoarded into “optics.”

Here’s how to intervene — practically and politically — while protecting the conscientious manager and surfacing the real value flows.

---

# **A. Diagnose the Energy Leak**

| Level               | Canon                  | Manifestation in this case                              | Signal to measure                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **θ′ (entropy)**    | Suffering / noise      | Overflow work, unreviewed files, client dissatisfaction | Rework rate, complaint frequency               |
| **θ (tactic)**      | Form                   | Manager 1 rubber-stamps to look efficient               | Avg. review time per file (too low = red flag) |
| **Σ (compression)** | Style                  | Manager 2 (overloaded) re-checks, cleans up errors      | Delta between submitted vs corrected outputs   |
| **h(t) (feedback)** | Drama                  | Complaints or audit exceptions escalate late            | Lag time between submission and correction     |
| **ΔS (ledger)**     | Beauty / audit clarity | Loss of trust, poor audit readiness                     | External audit findings, client NPS            |

This table helps explain to leadership that the *problem isn’t throughput — it’s compression without review*.
The bad manager treats (\varepsilon) as noise to be ignored; the good one encodes it as structured learning ((\varepsilon \to \varepsilon_t)).

---

# **B. Tactical Fixes — What to Do This Quarter**

1. **Introduce GitHub-like version control for accounting memos**

   * Each approval creates a diff trail (who changed what).
   * Visualizes “manager attention” — approvals without edits/comments become visible as low-engagement commits.
   * Eases audits, because version history replaces endless email chains.

2. **Require brief “review notes” per approval**

   * One sentence logged: *“Verified supporting docs, recalculated sample 5% variance — no issue.”*
   * Use this both as coaching and as a metric (comment density).

3. **Automate a “manager rework index”**

   * Count the % of tasks returned downstream (from client or QA) per manager.
   * High rework under low-review = rubber-stamp pattern.

4. **Client feedback rotation**

   * Rotate who interfaces with the client weekly.
   * If satisfaction improves when overloaded manager covers, the data expose the hidden (\varepsilon_t).

5. **Escalate with metrics, not emotions**

   * Present to director: “Manager A’s approvals show 2.5× rework and 3× audit exceptions compared to Manager B.”
   * Bureaucracies respect quantifiable differentials more than complaints.

---

# **C. Cultural / Leadership Tips**

1. **Frame the issue as calibration, not accusation.**

   * “We’re aligning review depth across sections to improve audit traceability.”
   * That phrasing disarms defensive managers while signaling standards.

2. **Define ‘added value’ explicitly.**

   * In this unit, *a manager adds value when downstream corrections decrease* — not when bosses are pleased.

3. **Upward education.**

   * Brief senior officers that *speed of approval* ≠ *efficiency*; it’s often *entropy compression failure*.
   * Use your data to prove this: clients re-open 30% of “fast” approvals.

4. **Protect the diligent manager’s bandwidth.**

   * Reallocate review load or introduce an assistant reviewer.
   * Make it visible that quality management takes time — that’s not inefficiency, that’s investment.

5. **Institutionalize version control as “audit visibility.”**

   * Label it a *risk-management innovation*, not a tech upgrade.
   * Bureaucracies love anything that says “traceable accountability.”

---

## **D. Optional: Quantify Each Manager’s (\varepsilon_t)**

If you can log outcomes, run the Python residual model from your section **A**.
Each manager’s “random effect” becomes their **managerial delta**: the value they add (or subtract) from expected subordinate performance.
Report it quietly:

* Positive (\varepsilon_t) = teaches, calibrates, improves client satisfaction.
* Negative (\varepsilon_t) = approves quickly but causes downstream entropy.

That creates a *scientific audit* of management value — very UN-compatible, very defendable.

---

# **E. Synthesis (Ukubona Style)**

> “Efficiency is not how fast you approve; it’s how little you must revisit.”
> — *Pyromancer Principle*

So:

* Treat the *approval trail* as **data**.
* Treat **feedback loops** as the real currency of leadership.
* And treat **version control** as moral infrastructure — the quiet art of turning bureaucracy back into intelligence.

---

Would you like me to draft a **one-page internal memo** that frames this as a *“Managerial Review Calibration Initiative”* (language suited for UN HR / oversight tone), with these concrete actions and audit rationale?

Looking at section **F**, it appears to be incomplete (just the header "# F" with no content following it).

Given the document's arc, here's what **F** might logically cover to complete the framework:

---

# F 

> *Field Implementation & Iteration*           
> -- Claude

Should include:

1. **Pilot timeline** (2-4 week experiment design)
   - Week 1: Instrument the approval pipeline
   - Week 2-3: Collect baseline data
   - Week 4: Run one experiment (rotation or blind re-review)

2. **Stakeholder communication plan**
   - How to brief senior management without triggering defensiveness
   - How to protect the conscientious manager during rollout
   - Language for framing this as "audit readiness" or "quality calibration"

3. **Iteration protocol**
   - Decision rules: at what threshold of $\varepsilon_t$ do you intervene?
   - Feedback loops: monthly check-ins to adjust metrics
   - Exit criteria: when has the system stabilized?

4. **Succession planning**
   - How to train new managers using this framework
   - Codifying the "good manager" pattern as institutional knowledge

---

Alternatively, **F** could be **"Frequently Anticipated Objections"** — preemptively addressing pushback like:
- "This feels like surveillance" → reframe as transparency
- "We don't have time for this" → show time saved by reducing rework
- "Metrics don't capture soft skills" → combine quant + qual data

Which direction feels more useful for your UN context?

## Take 2
> *Field Implementation & Iteration*  
> -- Grok (with a nod to Pyromancer's playbook and Claude's ukubona synthesis)

Thank you for the thoughtful arc—it's a elegant scaffold for turning managerial entropy into actionable intelligence. In the UN Accounting context, where layers of oversight (from section chiefs to OIOS audits) amplify the thermodynamic asymmetries you describe, the **Field Implementation & Iteration** direction resonates most. It grounds the framework in *deployable rituals* rather than just rebuttals, aligning with bureaucratic imperatives for traceability, phased rollouts, and iterative refinement. Objections (e.g., "surveillance") can be folded into the communication plan as preemptive reframes.

This section operationalizes the prior playbook into a **4-week pilot** tailored for a mid-sized accounting unit (e.g., 10-15 staff, 50-100 monthly approvals). It emphasizes low-friction tooling (GitHub for docs, Google Sheets for metrics) to sidestep IT procurement delays, while baking in moral hazard mitigations like anonymized reporting.

---

## 1. Pilot Timeline: A Lean 4-Week Cycle

Design for minimal disruption: target 20-30% of approvals (e.g., high-stakes memos or variance reports) to build signal without overwhelming the overloaded manager.

- **Week 1: Instrument the Approval Pipeline**  
  - **Actions**:  
    - Set up a shared GitHub repo (or equivalent: SharePoint with version history enabled) for all approvals. Mandate: upload draft → manager review → commit with notes → final merge.  
    - Log baseline signals in a Google Sheet: columns for `approval_id`, `submitter`, `manager`, `review_time_min`, `comment_count`, `rework_flag` (Y/N), `outcome_score` (e.g., client acceptance: 1-5).  
    - Quick win: Automate via Google Forms for 1:1 feedback ("Helpfulness in unblocking: 1-5") post-review.  
  - **Output**: Instrumented log with 10-15 historical entries for baseline `f(X)` model.  
  - **UN Fit**: Frame as "enhancing audit trail per ST/SGB/2009/8" (UN standards on document management).

- **Week 2-3: Collect & Baseline Data**  
  - **Actions**:  
    - Run parallel tracking: all approvals through the new pipeline.  
    - Compute initial residuals: Use the Python snippet (Section 3) on a subset—e.g., `outcome` as audit pass rate, predictors as `report_complexity` (page count) + `staff_experience` (years).  
    - Spot-check: Blind re-review 5 random approvals (anonymize via redaction tool).  
  - **Output**: First `ε_t` estimates per manager (e.g., Manager A: +0.08 rework reduction; Manager B: -0.03 audit exceptions).  
  - **Experiment Inject**: Mid-week 2, rotate 2-3 approvals across managers (e.g., "cross-section calibration exercise"). Track if performance follows the manager.  
  - **UN Fit**: Ties to quarterly performance compacts—position as "data-driven calibration for IPPAS compliance."

- **Week 4: Analyze & Iterate**  
  - **Actions**:  
    - Aggregate: Run the mixed-effects model; flag managers with |ε_t| > 0.05 for qualitative debrief (e.g., "What blockers did you surface?").  
    - Debrief huddle: 30-min team retro—"What felt like real value add vs. paperwork?"  
    - Threshold decision: If pilot rework drops >10%, scale to full unit; else, tweak (e.g., shorten review notes to 50 words).  
  - **Output**: One-page scorecard (managers anonymized as "Reviewer Alpha") + iteration log.  
  - **UN Fit**: Aligns with results-based management (RBM)—report as "pilot for enhanced managerial accountability."

**Total Effort**: ~2-4 hours/week per participant; scales via automation.

---

## 2. Stakeholder Communication Plan

Bureaucracies thrive on narrative alignment—lead with *shared wins* (audit-proofing, client trust) over critiques. Use a "funnel" approach: broad buy-in first, then targeted protection.

- **Senior Management Brief (Director/Chief)**:  
  - **Format**: 1-slide deck + 5-min pitch.  
  - **Framing**: "Calibrating managerial review depth to boost audit readiness and cut rework by 15-20%—inspired by Git for traceable efficiency."  
  - **Key Visual**: Your table from Section A, with a "Before/After" projection (e.g., rework rate: 25% → 15%).  
  - **Call to Action**: "Greenlight 4-week pilot on variance reports?"  
  - **Objection Preempt**: "This isn't surveillance—it's voluntary transparency, like ePerformance logs."

- **Peer/Manager Rollout (Team Huddle)**:  
  - **Format**: 15-min all-hands + handout.  
  - **Framing**: "Protecting our bandwidth: Spot the real value adds so we review smarter, not harder."  
  - **Protection for Conscientious Manager**: Anonymize in reports (e.g., "High-ε Reviewer"); allocate 20% review relief via junior shadowing. Highlight: "Your depth is our strength—let's quantify it to advocate for resources."  
  - **Incentives**: Tie to unit KPIs (e.g., +points for positive ε_t in annual compact).

- **HR/Oversight Loop-In**:  
  - Post-pilot memo (see your offer below): CC Ethics Office, emphasizing "fosters learning, not punishment."  
  - Escalation Guardrail: If pushback (e.g., "time sink"), counter with data: "Each prevented rework saves 2-3 hours downstream."

**Tone Throughout**: Collaborative curiosity—"We're co-calibrating for collective lift"—echoing UN values of integrity and mutual support.

---

## 3. Iteration Protocol: Rules for Refinement

Embed feedback as the core loop—avoid one-and-done pilots that fade into binders.

- **Decision Rules**:  
  | Threshold | Action | Rationale |  
  |-----------|--------|-----------|  
  | ε_t > +0.05 (consistent) | Spotlight as best practice; scale learnings (e.g., "Adopt Alpha's blocker-unsticking template"). | Amplifies positive asymmetry. |  
  | \|ε_t\| < 0.05 (neutral/variable) | Monthly 1:1 coaching; re-run rotation experiment. | Probes for hidden confounders (e.g., task mix). |  
  | ε_t < -0.05 (negative) | Non-punitive debrief: "What systemic blockers amplify entropy here?" Escalate to director if structural (e.g., understaffing). | Surfaces moral hazards without blame. |  

- **Feedback Loops**:  
  - Bi-weekly pulse: Anonymous Sheet survey ("Pipeline friction: 1-5?").  
  - Quarterly audit: Cross-check ε_t against external signals (client NPS, OIOS findings).  
  - Adaptive Metrics: If rework dominates, weight it 50%; add "learning actions completed" for growth signals.

- **Exit Criteria**:  
  - Success: Unit-wide adoption, >15% rework drop, stable ε_t variance <0.03.  
  - Pivot: If uptake <50%, simplify (e.g., notes-only, no Git). Reassess in 3 months.  
  - Sunset: When institutionalized in SOPs—hand off to next fiscal cycle.

**Pro Tip**: Use the Python snippet for automation—schedule a Colab notebook to email weekly ε_t dashboards.

---

## 4. Succession Planning: Codifying the Pattern

To prevent reversion (new managers rubber-stamping anew), weave this into onboarding.

- **Training Module**: 1-hour workshop—"Managerial ε_t: From Approval to Amplification."  
  - Cover: Signals checklist (Section 1), experiment basics, Python lite (residual calc demo).  
  - Hands-On: Mock approval with diff + note; compute toy ε_t.  

- **Institutional Knowledge**:  
  - Repo as living playbook: Add case studies (e.g., "How rotation exposed a 20% efficiency gap").  
  - Mentor Pairing: Pair new managers with high-ε_t veterans for 3-month shadowing.  
  - Legacy Metric: Track "ε_t handoff"—does the framework sustain post-rotation?  

- **Long-Term Embed**: Propose as unit innovation for UN-wide sharing (e.g., via iLibrary)—turns local fix into global good.

---

This closes the loop: from diagnosis (A) to tactics (B/C) to measurement (D) to synthesis (E) and now *sustainable rollout* (F). In UN terms, it's RBM meets thermodynamic justice—quantifiable, defensible, and humane.

On your offer: Yes, please draft that **one-page internal memo** as the "Managerial Review Calibration Initiative." Make it HR-polished, with audit rationale upfront and a nod to ST/SGB standards. If you'd like, I can mock up a sample Google Sheet template or extend the Python code for UN-specific predictors (e.g., factoring in "report_sensitivity" for high-stakes filings).

What's your next move—memo draft, or iterate on a specific signal for accounting memos?

## Epilogue
This is an excellent, field-ready implementation plan. Your "Take 2" for Section F perfectly translates the abstract framework into a concrete, 4-week pilot that respects the bureaucratic realities and "thermodynamic asymmetries" of the UN context.

The way you've woven in "UN Fit" justifications (e.g., "enhancing audit trail per ST/SGB/2009/8," "data-driven calibration for IPPAS compliance") and the stakeholder communication plan are particularly astute. This is how you enact change in such an environment: not by fighting the system, but by using its own principles (traceability, RBM, audit readiness) as leverage.

My next move is absolutely to draft the memo. Here is the one-page internal memorandum, crafted for the precise tone you requested.

---

### One-Page Internal Memo

**TO:** [Director / Section Chief Name]
**FROM:** [Your Name/Unit]
**DATE:** 28 October 2025
**SUBJECT: Proposal: Managerial Review Calibration Initiative (4-Week Pilot)**

#### 1. Rationale and Strategic Alignment

This memorandum proposes a 4-week pilot programme, the **Managerial Review Calibration Initiative**, designed to enhance the traceability, quality, and efficiency of our accounting review processes.

Our unit faces a dual mandate: ensuring rapid operational support while maintaining strict compliance with UN financial regulations and audit standards (e.g., IPPAS, ST/SGB/2009/8 on document management). Currently, the *value-add* of the managerial review stage—critical for catching errors, mentoring staff, and ensuring audit readiness—is not systematically measured.

This initiative provides a lightweight, data-driven framework to (a) quantify the impact of managerial review, (b) identify systemic blockers, and (c) create a more resilient and auditable workflow, directly supporting our Results-Based Management (RBM) commitments.

#### 2. Pilot Programme Overview

We will pilot this initiative over four weeks, focusing on a high-stakes workflow (e.g., variance reports or client-facing memos).

* **Objective**: To calibrate managerial review depth to maximize quality (reduce rework, lower audit exceptions) and efficiency.
* **Scope**: One to two teams; ~20-30% of selected approval workflows.
* **Method**: We will leverage existing tools (SharePoint/GitHub) to enhance version control and traceability. This will be paired with a simple log to track key, non-invasive metrics.
* **Ethos**: This is a non-punitive *calibration exercise*, not a performance surveillance tool. All data will be aggregated and anonymized in reports to identify systemic patterns, not individual performance.

#### 3. Key Principles and Methodology

The pilot is built on three core principles:

1.  **Enhanced Traceability**: By strengthening version control, we create a clear, time-stamped audit trail. This visualizes the review process, moving beyond a simple "approved" stamp to capture substantive comments and changes.
2.  **Data-Driven Insight**: We will track two types of indicators:
    * **Quality Indicators**: Rework rate (i.e., items returned by QA or clients), density of substantive review comments, and downstream audit/client exception rates.
    * **Efficiency Indicators**: Time-to-decision, time-to-resolution for blockers.
3.  **Collaborative Learning**: Data will be used to facilitate team-level discussions on best practices, common blockers, and resource needs. The goal is to learn from high-value review patterns and scale them.

#### 4. Expected Outcomes (4-Week Pilot)

* **Immediate (Qualitative)**: Clearer visibility into workflow bottlenecks and review engagement.
* **Short-Term (Quantitative)**: A baseline "rework rate" for the unit and an initial estimate of the impact of calibrated review (projected 10-15% reduction in rework).
* **Strategic (Compliance)**: A validated, auditable, and transparent review process that measurably reduces compliance risk and improves our posture for OIOS and external audits.
* **Cultural (Development)**: A shared understanding of "what good review looks like," supporting managerial development and staff mentoring.

#### 5. Next Steps

We seek your approval to commence this 4-week pilot on or before [Target Start Date]. Upon conclusion, we will present a one-page summary of findings and a recommendation on scaling the initiative.

---

This memo is designed to be the formal "wrapper" for the practical, effective plan you designed in Section F.

I will hold on the Google Sheet template, as you've got a strong handle on the required signals. The next logical step, pending approval of this memo, would be to build the simple `f(X)` baseline model from the historical data you gather in Week 1.
